# What an Expensive Time to be Alive: Analyzing the Cost of Living in Florida

# Project Description
This project delves into the factors contributing to the rising cost of living in Florida, with a focus on 2023. We aim to explore how population growth, housing and rental prices, economic conditions, and other factors have made Florida an increasingly expensive place to live. The assumption driving our analysis is that Florida's population growth has outpaced the availability of housing, impacting living costs significantly.

# Purpose
The purpose of this study is to understand the multifaceted reasons behind the increasing cost of living in Florida, examining the interplay between population dynamics, housing availability, economic conditions, and their collective impact on the state's residents.

# Tools and Technologies Used
Data Analysis and Visualization: Python (Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization)

Data Sources: Utilized datasets from FRED, USDA, Quilt Data, and other reputable sources for housing, rent, and population information.

Presentation: PowerPoint PDF for summarizing findings and recommendations.

# Findings and Conclusions
Population Growth: Florida's rapid population increase has contributed to a surplus in the labor market, which in turn, has put downward pressure on median salaries.

Housing Availability and Pricing: The population surge has led to a decrease in housing availability, causing a significant rise in both housing and rental prices.

Economic Impact: Increased interest rates have diminished purchasing power, exacerbating the affordability crisis for both renters and potential homeowners, while also driving up the cost of consumer goods.

# Recommendations
Policy Interventions: Encourage policy measures aimed at increasing housing supply to meet the demand and stabilize market prices.

Economic Strategies: Implement strategies to improve median salaries through economic diversification and job creation in higher-paying sectors.

Interest Rates: Advocate for balanced interest rate policies that consider the impact on housing affordability and the broader economy.

# Ethical Considerations
In conducting this analysis on the cost of living in Florida, we have adhered to several ethical principles to ensure the integrity and responsibility of our research:

Privacy and Data Protection: While utilizing publicly available datasets, we ensured that the data did not include personally identifiable information (PII) to respect privacy and comply with data protection laws. Our analysis focuses on aggregate trends rather than individual data points.

Accuracy and Honesty: We committed to presenting our findings accurately, avoiding any manipulation of data that could mislead or misrepresent the reality of the situation. Our interpretations are based on thorough analysis and are presented with honesty.

Bias and Fairness: Recognizing the potential for unconscious bias, we approached our analysis with an objective lens, critically examining our assumptions and methodologies to avoid biased conclusions. We sought to understand the multifaceted factors contributing to the cost of living, acknowledging that no single factor is solely responsible.

Impact on Communities: We are aware that our findings could have implications for various stakeholders, including policymakers, residents, and potential movers to Florida. Our analysis is intended to inform and enlighten discussions on housing and economic policies, aiming for solutions that are equitable and beneficial for the community at large.

Use of Public Data: The data sources we used are publicly available and intended for research purposes. We respect the terms of use of these sources and credit them in our project. Our use of this data is with the intention of contributing positively to public knowledge and understanding of the cost of living issues in Florida.
